    <p class="w3-justify">This is a sample HTML page that is intended to verify my GitHub account. I wish I had more to say here, but I honestly don't. I will say that this is dredging up unpleasant memories from CMSC433, though. At least this wasn't as much of a hassle to cobble together with that prior knowledge. I suppose you could consider this the main part of this webpage. Pictured above is my GitHub avatar, just for kicks. I'm sure you noticed that my GitHub account hosts a few Mega Man-related fangame projects, so this should come as no surprise.</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>There are a few cool things I can tell you about myself.</i></p><br>  
      <ol>
      	<li>As mentioned above, I code for a lot of fan-made projects. My personal main project has been ongoing for five years, which I feel tells you a lot about me right off the bat.</li>
        <li>My middle name is Daniel.</li>
        <li>My favorite color is orange.</li>
        <li>My second-favorite color is purple.</li>
        <li>I am well known for having a poor sense of style.</li>
        <li>I once memorized the entire periodic table in elementary school because I wanted to be a show-off.</li>
        <li>I have grown humbler with age.</li>
        <li>I am a member of an a capella group in my spare time.</li>
        <li>My favorite music genre is classic rock.</li>
        <li>Microsoft's music programs recognize most of my personal music library as either "mainstream rock" or "new wave", which I find both bizarre and somewhat demeaning.</li>
        <li>I am running out of interesting things to say about myself, like most other CS majors.</li>
        <li>This list was inspired by a similarly sarcastic section written by Stephan Pastis in a comic book I read as a child.</li>
        <li>I can't stand writing lists.</li>
        <li>I dislike hypocrisy.</li>
        <ul>4. Inconsistencies bother me.<ul>
        <li>I like to be cheeky wherever applicable.</li>
